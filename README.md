For each problem set (ps), follow the instructions in the pdf.

ps0 is very basic,

in ps1, we get to predict the time taken to be able to buy a house, provided with different salary , pay rise and down_payment

in ps2, we get to build a game hangman, with a library of secret words, hints, lives and warnings, which is very cool.

in ps3, we get to build a scrabble game, and practise unit testing to prevent bug.
